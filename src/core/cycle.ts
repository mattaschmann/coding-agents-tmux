// Priority ranking for the `cycle` command. Pure (no tmux/fs) so it is unit
// testable in isolation.
//
// Ordering is seen-major: unseen panes come first, then already-seen panes. The
// `cycle` command then rings over the unseen panes first (highest-priority
// first) and, once none remain unacknowledged, falls back to traversing the full
// ranked list so every agent pane is still reachable. Within each seen group,
// panes are ordered by attention tier (highest first), then oldest `statusSince`
// first (true FIFO — a long-waiting pane is never starved by newer arrivals):
//   0 waiting-question / waiting-input · 1 idle · 2 new · 3 running · 4 unknown
//
// "seen" means the pane was the active pane at some point since it entered its
// current status; it resets when the status changes (see cycle-ledger).
//
// Waiting panes are exempt from the seen demotion: they always sort as unseen.
// Glancing at an idle/new/running pane acknowledges it (review done), but
// glancing at a pane blocked on a prompt discharges nothing — only replying
// does — so a still-waiting pane must never sink below an unseen lower tier.
