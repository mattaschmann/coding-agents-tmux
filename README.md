# coding-agents-tmux

`tmux` integration for terminal coding agent sessions.

![coding-agents-tmux demo](docs/assets/coding-agents-tmux-demo.gif)

It helps you:

- open a chooser of active coding agent panes
- jump straight to panes waiting on your answer
- show the current pane state plus a background session summary in the status line
- use local plugin and hook state instead of relying only on sqlite or pane heuristics

This project was originally designed for `opencode` but has been extended to support `codex`, `pi`, `claude`, and `kiro` panes for discovery, switching, popup navigation, and status summaries.

Considering a dedicated agent multiplexer instead? See [how this plugin compares to Herdr](#how-this-compares-to-herdr).

## Install

Add the plugin to `~/.tmux.conf`:

```tmux
set -g @plugin 'corwinm/coding-agents-tmux'
```

Recommended settings:

```tmux
set -g @coding-agents-tmux-provider 'plugin'
set -g @coding-agents-tmux-auto-install 'opencode,pi,codex,claude'
set -g @coding-agents-tmux-menu-key 'O'
set -g @coding-agents-tmux-popup-key 'P'
set -g @coding-agents-tmux-waiting-menu-key 'W'
set -g @coding-agents-tmux-waiting-popup-key 'C-w'
set -g @coding-agents-tmux-cycle-key 'C-n'
set -g @coding-agents-tmux-status 'on'
set -g @coding-agents-tmux-status-style 'tmux'
set -g @coding-agents-tmux-status-position 'right'
set -g @coding-agents-tmux-status-interval '0'
```

Those settings favor the bundled plugin provider, explicitly enable tmux-managed installs for the bundled OpenCode plugin plus the Pi extension and Codex/Claude hooks, and use event-driven status redraws so tmux stops polling Node in the background.

To match your tmux theme, you can also override the status colors:

```tmux
set -g @coding-agents-tmux-status-color-neutral 'default'
set -g @coding-agents-tmux-status-color-idle 'colour244'
set -g @coding-agents-tmux-status-color-unseen 'colour39'
set -g @coding-agents-tmux-status-color-busy 'colour81'
set -g @coding-agents-tmux-status-color-waiting 'colour214'
set -g @coding-agents-tmux-status-color-unknown 'colour240'
```

Using `default` is a good way to let the segment inherit your existing tmux theme colors. The `unseen` color marks idle panes that have finished but that you have not looked at yet; such panes also use a distinct filled-circle glyph (versus the hollow idle circle) so they stand out even in the uncolored menu and popup. Once you focus the pane it reverts to the `idle` color and glyph.

Then install or reload TPM:

```tmux
prefix + I
```

Requirements:

- Node 24+ must be installed
- npm 10+ must be installed
- TPM will install CLI dependencies automatically on first load with `npm ci --omit=dev`
- `opencode` sessions must be restarted after first install so the bundled plugin is loaded
- `codex` sessions must be restarted after first install so newly installed hooks are loaded
- `pi` sessions must be restarted after first install so the bundled extension is loaded
- `claude` sessions must be restarted after Claude hook installation so new hooks are loaded

## What TPM sets up

With the recommended settings above, the tmux plugin manages the bundled `opencode` plugin, the Pi extension, and the Codex and Claude hook installs for you.

It installs the bundled `opencode` plugin at:

```text
~/.config/opencode/plugins/coding-agents-tmux.ts
```

That plugin publishes normalized session state files under:

```text
~/.local/state/coding-agents-tmux/plugin-state
```

On first install, the tmux plugin also bootstraps the CLI runtime dependencies inside:

```text
~/.tmux/plugins/coding-agents-tmux/node_modules
```

It also installs or updates the bundled Pi extension under:

```text
~/.pi/agent/extensions/coding-agents-tmux/index.ts
```

That extension publishes normalized Pi state files under:

```text
~/.local/state/coding-agents-tmux/pi-state
```

It also installs or updates Codex hook integration under:

```text
~/.codex/config.toml
~/.codex/hooks.json
```

With the recommended `@coding-agents-tmux-auto-install 'opencode,pi,codex,claude'` setting, it also installs or updates Claude Code hook integration under:

```text
~/.claude/settings.json
```

You can disable the automatic symlink step with:

```tmux
set -g @coding-agents-tmux-install-opencode-plugin 'off'
```

You can disable the automatic Pi extension setup with:

```tmux
set -g @coding-agents-tmux-install-pi-extension 'off'
```

You can disable the automatic Codex hook setup with:

```tmux
set -g @coding-agents-tmux-install-codex-hooks 'off'
```

You can disable the automatic Claude Code hook setup with:

```tmux
set -g @coding-agents-tmux-install-claude-hooks 'off'
```

You can also control all tmux-managed installs together:

```tmux
set -g @coding-agents-tmux-auto-install 'auto'
set -g @coding-agents-tmux-auto-install 'off'
set -g @coding-agents-tmux-auto-install 'opencode,pi,codex,claude'
```

The explicit `opencode,pi,codex,claude` list is the recommended README setting because it makes the intended managed installs obvious in your tmux config. When `@coding-agents-tmux-auto-install` is set, it takes precedence over the individual install toggles.

## Usage

Default key bindings:

- `prefix + O` opens the main menu chooser
- `prefix + P` opens the main popup chooser
- `prefix + W` jumps to the only waiting session, or opens a waiting-only menu if there are multiple
- `prefix + C-w` opens the waiting-only popup chooser
- `prefix + C-n` cycles to the next agent pane that needs attention (see [Smart cycling](#smart-cycling))

Launcher behavior:

- `menu` uses a tmux menu and is the most reliable option
- `popup` opens a popup chooser if you prefer a larger interactive view

Inside the popup you can do more than pick a row number:

- type to filter the list by target, session, title, state, or path
- use the up and down arrows or `Ctrl-J` / `Ctrl-K` to move through the matching panes
- use `Ctrl-G` then `1` through `9` to immediately open the matching visible row
- press `Enter` to switch to the selected pane
- press `Esc` to close the popup or `Ctrl-R` to refresh the live pane list

You can configure each binding independently:

```tmux
set -g @coding-agents-tmux-menu-key 'O'
set -g @coding-agents-tmux-popup-key 'P'
set -g @coding-agents-tmux-waiting-menu-key 'W'
set -g @coding-agents-tmux-waiting-popup-key 'C-w'
set -g @coding-agents-tmux-cycle-key 'C-n'
```

Set any of them to `off` to disable that binding.

## Smart cycling

`prefix + C-n` jumps straight to the agent pane that most needs your attention,
so you do not have to open a chooser and scan the list yourself. Press it
repeatedly to walk through every agent pane in priority order.

Panes are ranked by attention tier, highest first:

| Tier | Pane state                                | Why                            |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| 1    | waiting for a question or free-form input | blocked on you right now       |
| 2    | idle                                      | finished; may need review      |
| 3    | new                                       | just started, nothing yet      |
| 4    | running                                   | working; nothing for you to do |
| 5    | unknown                                   | no reliable signal             |

Within a tier, the pane that has been in its state **longest** comes first
(true FIFO), so a session that has been waiting a while is never starved by
newer arrivals.

### Seen vs. unseen

Cycling tracks which panes you have already looked at. A pane counts as **seen**
once it has been the active pane at any point since it entered its current
state — so ordinary tmux navigation acknowledges panes too, not just cycling. A
pane becomes **unseen** again when its state changes (for example, a running
session goes idle, or an idle session starts waiting on a prompt).

Unseen panes are offered before seen ones. Cycling first sweeps every pane you
have not looked at — highest priority first, across tiers — so an unseen running
pane comes before a seen idle one. Waiting panes get priority while unseen but
are never trapped there: once you have glanced at every unseen pane, cycling
falls back to traversing the full ranked list so every pane stays reachable.
Waiting panes are the exception to the seen demotion in the _ordering_: a glance
does not answer a prompt, so a still-waiting pane always sorts ahead of lower
tiers. Cycling never dead-ends: as long as there is more than one agent pane,
`C-n` always moves.

Unseen idle panes are also marked in the [status line](#status-line) and in the
menu and popup choosers with a distinct filled circle (and a blue color where
colors are available), so you can tell at a glance which finished sessions you
have not yet reviewed.

### Example

Three agents: **A** waiting on a prompt, **B** just finished (idle), **C** still
running — none looked at yet.

- Press `C-n` → jumps to **A** (waiting outranks everything).
- Press `C-n` → jumps to **B** (idle outranks running).
- Press `C-n` → jumps to **C** (running is last).
- Press `C-n` → all three are now seen, so cycling falls back to the full ranked
  list and wraps back to **A**: still waiting, so still first in line.

Once you answer **A**'s prompt it leaves the waiting tier and, now seen, sinks
behind anything you have not reviewed. But while it is still waiting, glancing at
it does not push it down — a pane blocked on you stays ahead of an unseen idle or
running pane, not behind it.

If **C** later goes idle, it becomes unseen again — so the next `C-n` jumps
straight to it ahead of every seen pane, not just those in its own tier.

The cycle key is configurable like the other bindings, and can be disabled with
`off`:

```tmux
set -g @coding-agents-tmux-cycle-key 'C-n'
```

Cycling records what it has observed under:

```text
~/.local/state/coding-agents-tmux/cycle-state
```

This holds one small file per pane (the pane's last observed state, when it
entered that state, and whether it has been seen). It is derived data and safe
to delete — cycling simply starts from a clean slate, treating every pane as
unseen again.

## OpenCode session tabs

OpenCode's V2 TUI can hold several sessions in one pane as tabs. Only the
focused tab is visible, so a background tab blocked on a prompt would otherwise
go unnoticed — no glyph change and no notification, exactly the case the
indicator exists for.

When a pane has tabs, its reported state is the **roll-up** across all of them:
the pane shows the highest-attention state any tab is in. So a background tab
waiting on a permission or question prompt makes the whole pane render waiting —
it lights up in the [status line](#status-line), fires your notify command, and
[cycling](#smart-cycling) treats it as top priority — even while the tab you are
looking at sits idle. The focused tab still owns the pane's title and session
identity; the roll-up only ever raises the reported attention, never lowers it,
so a prompt on the focused tab is never masked by an idle background tab.

`inspect` shows the per-tab breakdown for a multi-tab pane, with `*` marking the
focused tab:

```text
Tabs
    waiting-input  Weekly update  [ses_…]
  * idle           Main task      [ses_…]
```

This is automatic and needs no configuration. Panes without tabs (and OpenCode
V1) are unaffected — their state is reported exactly as before.

## Status line

When enabled, the status line shows two views at once:

- the current pane state
- a compact summary of the remaining detected coding-agent panes

Example output, rendered as an image so the Nerd Font icons show on GitHub:

![coding-agents-tmux status line examples](docs/assets/status-line-examples.png)

The default prefix is the Nerd Font robot glyph shown in the rendered examples above. You can also replace it with your own label:

```tmux
set -g @coding-agents-tmux-status-prefix 'agents'
```

This means:

- The first row means the focused pane is idle and the background panes are waiting, busy, and idle in target order.
- The second row means the focused pane is busy and more than eight background panes are shown in compact symbol mode.
- The third row means the focused pane is newly started and there are no other detected coding-agent panes.

If your active pane is not a detected coding-agent pane, the status line uses the strongest detected coding-agent pane in the current tmux window. Other panes are counted as background work.

Background pane symbols are shown in a stable target order:

- <img src="docs/assets/icons/status-waiting.png" width="14" alt="waiting icon"> waiting
- <img src="docs/assets/icons/status-busy.png" width="14" alt="busy icon"> busy
- <img src="docs/assets/icons/status-idle.png" width="14" alt="idle icon"> idle (hollow circle; shown once you have focused the pane)
- unseen idle (filled circle, blue): finished but not yet looked at — changes to the hollow idle circle after you focus it
- <img src="docs/assets/icons/status-new.png" width="14" alt="new icon"> new
- <img src="docs/assets/icons/status-unknown.png" width="14" alt="unknown icon"> unknown

The unseen-idle marker is a distinct glyph as well as a distinct color, so it is still distinguishable in the uncolored menu and popup choosers. It reflects the same seen/unseen tracking that drives [smart cycling](#smart-cycling).

By default the status line adds spaces between background pane symbols for readability. If there are more than eight background panes, it automatically switches to a compact no-space form.

Enable or tune the status line with:

```tmux
set -g @coding-agents-tmux-status 'on'
set -g @coding-agents-tmux-status-style 'tmux'
set -g @coding-agents-tmux-status-position 'right'
set -g @coding-agents-tmux-status-interval '0'
```

By default the plugin uses manual mode so your theme can place the segment itself.

With the bundled plugin provider, `0` makes the status line event-driven: session events and tmux navigation hooks trigger redraws instead of polling on a timer. If you switch to the `sqlite` or `server` provider, set a positive interval if you still want periodic background refreshes.

For Catppuccin, use the renamed module export:

```tmux
set -g @coding-agents-tmux-status 'on'
set -g @coding-agents-tmux-status-mode 'manual'

set -g status-right "#{E:@catppuccin_status_session}"
set -ag status-right "#{E:@catppuccin_status_directory}"
set -ag status-right "#{E:@catppuccin_status_agents}"
```

For other themes, use the tone-aware inline export:

```tmux
set -g @coding-agents-tmux-status 'on'
set -g @coding-agents-tmux-status-mode 'manual'

set -ag status-right " #{@coding-agents-tmux-status-inline-format}"
```

If you want to fully control the wrapper yourself, use the plain text export instead:

```tmux
set -ag status-right " #[fg=colour81]agents #[default]#{@coding-agents-tmux-status-text}"
```

`manual` mode is the default. `#{E:@catppuccin_status_agents}` gives Catppuccin users a native-looking module, `#{@coding-agents-tmux-status-inline-format}` gives other themes a tone-aware inline segment, and `#{@coding-agents-tmux-status-text}` gives a plain live summary text export for fully custom wrappers. `append` mode restores the old behavior and appends automatically.

## External integrations

The CLI exposes the same state used by the tmux segment as a stable machine-readable summary:

```bash
~/.tmux/plugins/coding-agents-tmux/bin/coding-agents-tmux status --summary --json
```

The JSON includes totals by state, the aggregate tone, and the rendered summary. External status bars and widgets can query it without duplicating agent detection.

Set a generic notification command to update an external integration whenever agent state or the tmux pane layout changes:

```tmux
set -g @coding-agents-tmux-notify-command 'sketchybar --trigger coding_agents_changed'
```

The command is optional, runs after state changes, and is ignored when unset. It remains active when the tmux status segment is disabled.

Bundled examples:

- [`integrations/sketchybar`](integrations/sketchybar) renders the global agent summary in SketchyBar without polling
- [`integrations/external`](integrations/external) focuses a configured terminal and launches the full popup or compact menu from AeroSpace, Raycast, Hammerspoon, or another external launcher

When TPM installs the plugin in its default directory, launch either chooser with the bundled external script:

```bash
~/.tmux/plugins/coding-agents-tmux/integrations/external/focus-and-popup.sh
~/.tmux/plugins/coding-agents-tmux/integrations/external/focus-and-popup.sh --waiting
~/.tmux/plugins/coding-agents-tmux/integrations/external/focus-and-popup.sh --menu
```

The script selects the most recently active attached tmux client by default. Set `CODING_AGENTS_TMUX_CLIENT` to target one explicitly. Terminal placement and native focus remain the responsibility of the external window manager or launcher.

- `@coding-agents-tmux-status-color-unknown` tmux color for unknown/none state, default `colour244`
- `@coding-agents-tmux-notify-command` optional shell command invoked after agent or tmux layout state changes

## Providers

Recommended provider:

- `plugin` for the best waiting/running/idle detection in normal local `opencode` sessions, and the default tmux integration provider

Provider modes:

- `auto` uses plugin state when available, then server endpoints, then sqlite
- `plugin` uses only plugin state files
- `sqlite` uses the local `opencode` sqlite database
- `server` uses explicit `opencode serve` endpoints from `@coding-agents-tmux-server-map`

Example:

```tmux
set -g @coding-agents-tmux-provider 'plugin'
```

## Pi

`pi` panes are detected from the live tmux pane command and common title patterns, so they show up in `list`, `switch`, `popup`, and `status` alongside `opencode`, `codex`, `claude`, and `kiro` panes.

Use `--agent opencode`, `--agent codex`, `--agent pi`, `--agent claude`, `--agent kiro`, or `--agent all` on `list`, `switch`, `popup`, `popup-ui`, and `status` when you want to narrow mixed tmux environments.

For the best Pi runtime fidelity, let the tmux plugin install the bundled Pi extension automatically. It is linked into:

```text
~/.pi/agent/extensions/coding-agents-tmux/index.ts
```

That extension publishes pane-aware Pi state under:

```text
~/.local/state/coding-agents-tmux/pi-state
```

Pi runtime support is intentionally minimal and extensible:

- with the bundled Pi extension loaded, Pi panes can report `new`, `running`, `idle`, `waiting-question`, and `waiting-input`
- blocking Pi extension UI prompts, including `ask_user_question`, are reported as waiting until the prompt closes
- without the extension, `coding-agents-tmux` falls back to pane preview heuristics when possible
- if preview is inconclusive, Pi falls back to a coarse `running` state when a `pi` process is still detected in the tmux pane
- Pi has no built-in permission or plan mode integration here yet, so those states are not modeled specially

After first install or update, restart Pi sessions in tmux so they load the bundled extension.

## Codex

`codex` panes are detected from the live tmux pane command, so they show up in `list`, `switch`, `popup`, and `status` alongside `opencode`, `pi`, `claude`, and `kiro` panes.

Use `--agent opencode`, `--agent codex`, `--agent pi`, `--agent claude`, `--agent kiro`, or `--agent all` on `list`, `switch`, `popup`, `popup-ui`, and `status` when you want to narrow mixed tmux environments.

Default Codex runtime support is intentionally coarse:

- if a tmux pane is running a `codex` process, it is classified as `running`
- waiting, question, and idle distinctions are still `opencode`-specific until a stronger Codex-local state source is added

To enable higher-fidelity Codex state with Codex hooks:

1. Let the tmux plugin install the global Codex config automatically, or run it manually:

```bash
~/.tmux/plugins/coding-agents-tmux/bin/coding-agents-tmux install-codex
```

2. Optionally generate an additional repo-local hooks file:

```bash
mkdir -p .codex
~/.tmux/plugins/coding-agents-tmux/bin/coding-agents-tmux codex-hooks-template > .codex/hooks.json
```

3. Restart `codex` sessions in tmux so they begin publishing hook-backed state.

With hooks enabled, `coding-agents-tmux` can mark Codex panes as `idle` or `waiting-input` between turns instead of showing every Codex pane as continuously `running`.

## Claude Code

`claude` panes are detected from the live tmux pane command and common title patterns, so they show up in `list`, `switch`, `popup`, and `status` alongside `opencode`, `codex`, `pi`, and `kiro` panes.

Default Claude Code runtime support is intentionally coarse:

- if a tmux pane is running a `claude` process, it is classified as `running`
- waiting, question, and idle distinctions become higher fidelity when Claude hooks are installed

To enable higher-fidelity Claude Code state with hooks:

1. Install or update the global Claude hook config manually:

```bash
~/.tmux/plugins/coding-agents-tmux/bin/coding-agents-tmux install-claude
```

2. Or let the tmux plugin manage it by setting either:

```tmux
set -g @coding-agents-tmux-install-claude-hooks 'on'
```

or the shared selector:

```tmux
set -g @coding-agents-tmux-auto-install 'opencode,pi,codex,claude'
```

3. Optionally inspect the managed hook template before merging it into project or user Claude settings:

```bash
~/.tmux/plugins/coding-agents-tmux/bin/coding-agents-tmux claude-hooks-template
```

4. Restart `claude` sessions in tmux so they begin publishing hook-backed state.

With hooks enabled, `coding-agents-tmux` can mark Claude panes as `idle`, `waiting-question`, or `waiting-input` between turns instead of showing every Claude pane as continuously `running`.

## Kiro CLI

`kiro` panes are detected from live tmux pane commands such as `kiro-cli`, `kiro-cli-chat`, `kiro-cli-term`, and `kiro`, plus common title patterns. They show up in `list`, `switch`, `popup`, and `status` alongside the other supported coding agents.

Kiro runtime support is intentionally simple and does not require any Kiro agent configuration:

- if a tmux pane is running a Kiro CLI process, it is classified as `idle` unless preview text shows an obvious waiting prompt
- pane preview heuristics can detect obvious question or approval prompts as waiting states
- no Kiro hooks are installed or required; Kiro support is based on tmux process/title detection and preview fallback only
- the session column uses a lightweight pane-derived label, usually the current directory basename

This means any `kiro-cli` pane can be discovered and switched to without naming or modifying a Kiro custom agent.

## How this compares to Herdr

[coding-agents-tmux](https://github.com/corwinm/coding-agents-tmux) adds coding-agent awareness to an existing tmux setup. [Herdr](https://github.com/herdrdev/herdr) is a separate terminal multiplexer built around coding agents. They solve a similar navigation problem, but at different layers.

| State detail               | Distinguishes running, idle, new, free-form input, multiple-choice questions, and unknown state                                 | Uses working, blocked, idle, and unknown pane states, with done derived for unseen completed work                      |
| Agent coverage             | Focused support for OpenCode, Codex, Pi, Claude Code, and Kiro CLI                                                              | Broader built-in detection across many agent CLIs                                                                      |
| Navigation and UI          | tmux menus, popups, key bindings, status formats, and existing tmux themes                                                      | A dedicated agent sidebar and UI, plus its own CLI and socket API                                                      |
| Persistence and remote use | Uses tmux persistence and whatever SSH, mosh, or tmux workflow you already have                                                 | Owns persistent terminal sessions and provides its own attach and remote workflow                                      |
| Extensibility              | TypeScript providers and agent-specific hooks or plugins                                                                        | Declarative screen-detection manifests plus agent integrations and an API                                              |

Choose this plugin when tmux is already the center of your terminal workflow. It keeps your current sessions and configuration intact, and adds a quick way to find the agent that needs attention.

Choose Herdr when you want the multiplexer itself to understand agents and expose that state through a dedicated UI and API. Owning the terminal gives Herdr broader process and screen visibility, but using it means managing those panes in Herdr rather than tmux.

The two projects can be installed on the same machine for separate workflows, but they do not share pane state. This plugin discovers tmux panes; it cannot inspect individual panes nested inside a Herdr session.

State accuracy in either project depends on the agent. Native hooks and plugins provide stronger lifecycle signals, while screen-based detection can need updates when an agent changes its terminal UI.

## Troubleshooting

- `prefix + O` or `prefix + P` does nothing: make sure `node` and `npm` are installed and reload tmux
- first TPM load feels slow: the plugin may be running `npm ci --omit=dev` to bootstrap dependencies
- new panes show stale state: restart the `opencode` session so it reloads the plugin
- waiting detection seems wrong: use the `plugin` provider and confirm the bundled plugin symlink exists at `~/.config/opencode/plugins/coding-agents-tmux.ts`
- Pi still looks busy or unknown: confirm the bundled extension exists at `~/.pi/agent/extensions/coding-agents-tmux/index.ts` and restart the Pi session so it loads the extension
- Codex still always looks busy: confirm `~/.codex/config.toml` has `hooks = true` under `[features]`, `~/.codex/hooks.json` exists, and restart the Codex session
- Claude still always looks busy: confirm `~/.claude/settings.json` contains the managed `claude-hook-state` hook command and restart the Claude Code session
- status looks stale with `sqlite` or `server`: set `@coding-agents-tmux-status-interval` to a positive value because event-driven refreshes are centered on the bundled plugin provider
- TPM install changed but tmux still looks old: run `prefix + I` or `tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf`

## Local development sync

If you edit this repo outside `~/.tmux/plugins/coding-agents-tmux`, tmux will still be using the TPM-installed copy until you sync it.

Local development requires ShellCheck. On macOS, install it with Homebrew:

```bash
brew install shellcheck
```

Useful commands:

```bash
npm run sync-tmux
npm run sync-tmux -- --reload
npm run sync-tmux -- --bootstrap --reload
npm run restore-tmux
```

- `sync-tmux` copies this checkout into `~/.tmux/plugins/coding-agents-tmux`
- `--reload` runs `tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf` after syncing
- `--bootstrap` reinstalls production dependencies in the synced plugin copy when `package.json` changed
- `restore-tmux` removes the synced development files, preserves `node_modules`, and returns the TPM checkout to a clean state so `prefix + U` can update it normally

Run `npm run restore-tmux` when you finish local development or before asking TPM to update all plugins.

## CLI

The repository also includes a CLI for debugging and manual inspection.

Useful commands:

```bash
~/.tmux/plugins/coding-agents-tmux/bin/coding-agents-tmux list --provider plugin
~/.tmux/plugins/coding-agents-tmux/bin/coding-agents-tmux list --agent codex
~/.tmux/plugins/coding-agents-tmux/bin/coding-agents-tmux list --agent pi
~/.tmux/plugins/coding-agents-tmux/bin/coding-agents-tmux list --agent claude
~/.tmux/plugins/coding-agents-tmux/bin/coding-agents-tmux list --agent kiro
~/.tmux/plugins/coding-agents-tmux/bin/coding-agents-tmux list --provider plugin --waiting
~/.tmux/plugins/coding-agents-tmux/bin/coding-agents-tmux inspect <target> --provider plugin
~/.tmux/plugins/coding-agents-tmux/bin/coding-agents-tmux status --provider plugin --style tmux
~/.tmux/plugins/coding-agents-tmux/bin/coding-agents-tmux status --summary --json
~/.tmux/plugins/coding-agents-tmux/bin/coding-agents-tmux popup --client auto
~/.tmux/plugins/coding-agents-tmux/bin/coding-agents-tmux menu --client auto
~/.tmux/plugins/coding-agents-tmux/bin/coding-agents-tmux cycle --provider plugin
~/.tmux/plugins/coding-agents-tmux/bin/coding-agents-tmux tmux-config --provider plugin
```

`cycle` is normally driven by the `prefix + C-n` key binding (see
[Smart cycling](#smart-cycling)); the CLI form is mainly useful for debugging.
